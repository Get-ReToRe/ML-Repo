Machine Learning path for capstone project from Team C23-PS041 ðŸ™Œ of Bangkit 2023, GetReToRe App development and documentation repository.

# Introduction
Get-ReToRe is a recommendation application for tourist attractions for backpackers with a limited budget. Get-ReToRe will recommend tourist attractions based on the budget of the backpacker, the category of tourist attractions, and the closest tourist location to the backpacker. Get-ReToRe uses Collaborative filtering to select tourist attractions according to user requests

# Budget Recommendation Feature
Get-ReToRe seeks to help tourists, especially backpackers who have limited funds, in finding tourism spots. Backpackers can use Get-ReToRe to get recommendations for tourism places based on their budget and the category of tourism places.

# Recommendation of Travel Destination by Images
We would like to implement fresh idea about input or filtering the dataset of getting travel destination recommendation by categories for users by uploading an image that has closest features and visual for the one of the 6 categories.

# Recommendation System
Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user may be interested in based on the reactions of other users. It operates by scanning a huge group of individuals for users who have similar likes to a specific user.

Content-based recommenders approach suggestion as a user-specific classification issue, learning a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on the attributes of an item. Keywords are utilized to define the items in this system, and a user profile is created to identify the sort of thing this person prefers.

# Dataset
The dataset used in the application uses references from kaggle with the limitation of tourism places over 6 big cities in Indonesia for our Budget Recommendation Feature. We also use other reference of dataset which has similar with our ideas flow to test the image classification models for getting Recommendation of Travel Destination by Images.
