# Recommendation System
Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user may be interested in based on the reactions of other users. It operates by scanning a huge group of individuals for users who have similar likes to a specific user.

Content-based recommenders approach suggestion as a user-specific classification issue, learning a classifier for the user's likes and dislikes based on the attributes of an item. Keywords are utilized to define the items in this system, and a user profile is created to identify the sort of thing this person prefers.
